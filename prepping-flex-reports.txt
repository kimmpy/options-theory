1. go into the directory that has all the flex reports and type in terminal:
	grep -e "      2.*" -e "      2.*" (file name) > tmpfile && mv (file name)
this clears the headers in the file




2. paste the header into the top of the file (copy and paste EXACT line with exact spacing)
   SYMBOL   P/C   EXPIRATION   STRIKE-PRICE   MARK-PRICE   OPEN-INTEREST  




3. to combine all of the txt files into one dataframe, type all this after typing python3 in terminal:

import pandas as pd
import glob

# Get a list of all TXT files in a directory
txt_files = glob.glob('/home/kim/data/flex-reports/4-april/*.txt')

# Create an empty dataframe to store the combined data
combined_df = pd.DataFrame()

# Loop through each CSV file and append its contents to the combined dataframe
for txt_file in txt_files:
    df = pd.read_fwf(txt_file)
    combined_df = pd.concat([combined_df, df])

# Print the combined dataframe
print(combined_df)
